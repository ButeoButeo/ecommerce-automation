# ecommerce-automation
This project contains automated test cases for the e-commerce website using Playwright with the Page Object Model (POM). The test cases cover specified scenarios.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine.

# Framework setup and installation 
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ButeoButeo/ecommerce-automation
2. cd ecommerce-automation
3. npm i

## Setting up the local environment
Inside every application folder, there is a `.env.example` file that you can use as a template to create your own `.env` file.

You can use the following command to copy the file and create your own `.env` file:

```shell
cd ecommerce-automation
cp .env.example .env
```

For example, assuming we want to test the ecommerce-automation application, the `.env` file would look like this:

```dotenv
BASE_URL=https://www.fashionworld.co.uk/ # This will run the tests against the web application
BASIC_AUTH_EMAIL=your account email
BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=your password email
```
For security reasons the new browser may ask for a sended email code to login validation. Fill the code sended when run the setup(first to run)

In proper staging environment this step should be asked to be disabled in order to run automation.
